Basic README file, original version.
First update: This signifies I will now try to clone my own GitHub repo somewhere else (to later cause trouble!)  
feature/more_README_text: just add a new line for now (maybe fix things above later).  
feature/more_README_text: adding another new ine for now (another try on pull request w/o merge conflicsts).  
feature/more_README_text: adding new line AND editing old lines - may not auto-approve merging now.  
feature/more_README_text: one more extra line, so 'oringial' viewer can fetch and check it out in git manually.  
feature/more_README_text: this one will hopefully cause merge conflict (editing in two branches).
